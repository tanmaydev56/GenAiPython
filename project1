You're building a Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion, 
an AI model that converts text prompts (like "Rainy forest with fog") 
into high-quality images. 
This is a popular tool for artists, designers, and developers.


1.Core Technology
    Uses diffusers library (Hugging Face) + PyTorch
    Leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion v1.5 model
    Runs on GPU (faster) or CPU (slower but works)

2.Workflow
Text Prompt → AI Model → Generated Image → Save/Display

3.Features
    Customizable prompts (any scene/style)
    Optimized for speed (torch.float16)
    Auto-detects GPU/CPU
